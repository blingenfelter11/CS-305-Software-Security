# CS-305-Software-Security

  My client was Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments and insurance for their patrons. Artemis Financial were seeking to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. Reading the vulnerability reprot and identifying the false postives from the list was something I found that I did well. Coding securley is important to help keep your project from being vulnerable to attacks. Software security helps keep a company's customers confidence high and protects the company's reputation. Understanding the assessment report was a challenge at first before I became acustomed to the layout of the report. I increased the layers of security by adding encryption to the project. In my future projects I will utilize the tools I learned in this course to help me find and correct vulnerabilities.
  
    To ensure that the code was secure and functional I refactored the code and rerean the test. Generating the vulnerability reports and creating security certificates are tools I will use in the future. From the completed assignment I could show multiple things to future employers to demonstrate my knowledge. I could show them the refactored code and the vulnerability reports to show that I can find and fix vulnerabilities. I could also show my practice using keystore and adding encryption to projects.
